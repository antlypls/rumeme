= RuMeMe
Ruby SDK for Message Media SMS Gateway API.
Since Message Media doesn't provide any ruby projects support, we decided to port it from available SDKs (mainly from PHP SDK; and some .NET usage). 
For more information checkout {Message Media SMS APIs}[http://www.message-media.com/sms-gateway.html].

= To Do
* Refactoring to make api more rubyish.
* Add unit tests
* Extend documentation with Usage section.
